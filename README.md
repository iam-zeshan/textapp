this is it again,
Made this application (Demo) with ReactJs for learning.

What this is about?
This application is just saving your ToDo list in your localhost browser's cache, and you can perform certain actions i.e
- Adding a new ToDo line
- Deleting, Updating, and some other stuf you can do by using this application.

* I've made this application with the help of a tutorial.
